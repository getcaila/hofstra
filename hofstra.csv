Chekhov’s stories represent aculmination of certain Western European as well as Russian traditionsof the diminutive prose form. The evolution of the Russian short storywill be traced from its formal beginnings (inspired by FrenchSentimentalism) through the works of the major nineteenth century prosewriters such as Pushkin and Gogol.

bulletin.hofstra.edu,CLL,CLL181,(LT) Hybrid Identities in Literature,3,,PeriodicallyThe French philosopher and social thinker Michel Foucault once wrote that each should “cultivate [his or her] legitimate strangeness.”  This course explores characters in world literature from the middle of the 19th century to the present who are caught between cultures; classes or even countries; individuals who are already deemed to be “strange” or difficult to categorize or pigeonhole because they belong to more than one social world. Needless to say; those who acknowledge and actively cultivate any hybrid identity or sense of difference run the risk of a more radical break from the society in which they live; often their multifaceted identities coincide with a multiculturalism that cannot be acknowledged by the monolithic community that surrounds them.  We will examine a range of characters in works from Europe; the United States; South America and Asia who exemplify this dynamic of an outsider consciousness; paying particularly close attention to details

What is the proper response  to the possibility if the “dehumanization” of individual identity and mass culture?  In attempting to answer this question; writers often find themselves asking what  is really human; and how the natural can be effectively distinguished from the  manufactured. We will discuss both the resistance to technology and the often  difficult embrace of it; reading authors such as Mary Shelley; E.T.A. Hoffman;  Karel Capek; Franz Kafka; Stanislaw Lem and William Gibson.

bulletin.hofstra.edu,GEOL,GEOL155,Internship in Geology and Environmental Resources,1-6,Fall,January; Spring; SummerStudents will apply skills and concepts learned in their geology major to a job or research project at an external geotechnical firm; environmental firm; engineering firm; or research internship sponsored by NASA; The Geological Society of America; National Science Foundation (NSF); or other established research institution. Prerequisite(s)/Course Notes: Approval of department chairperson and a minimum GPA of 3.0 in major course work. The internship course is an enrichment of the academic experience and will not substitute for any required courses in the geology degree programs but will count toward liberal arts elective credits. The Hofstra faculty internship mentor will assign a letter grade based on the average of the grade on the report and/or presentation and the on-site evaluation grade with the caveat that an on-site evaluation of “poor” or “unacceptable” will result in a grade no higher than a C. The course is offered on an independent study basis. Credit is calculated based on a total time commitment of approximately 38 hours per credit. This must include a minimum of 28 hours per credit off campus; plus at most 10 hours spent pursuing on-campus research or ancillary assignments. All students are expected to keep a journal documenting their progress and experiences in the internship. Students will also be expected write a final report detailing their experiences and reflecting on how they applied the skills and concepts learned as a geology major to their internship. Alternatively; a technical report or research paper may be presented based on the research conducted during the internship. Also acceptable would be a published abstract and presentation at a local or national professional meeting.

bulletin.hofstra.edu,PHI,PHI012,(HP) What Does It All Mean? Life; Meaning and Philosophy,3,Fall&Spring,The question of the meaning of life is inextricably entangled with other philosophical questions.  On one view; life can only have purpose if God exists.  This requires examination of the reasons for and against the idea that God exists.  A related view holds that unless we have immortal souls; our lives are too brief to be genuinely significant.  This requires examination of the reasons for thinking that humans have such souls.   A third view holds that we can give our life meaning through the free choices we make. This raises the question of whether we have free will; or whether our choices are predetermined; it also raises the questions of whether the choices we make should be ethical choices; and what it is to act ethically (whether; for example one should focus on the consequences of one’s actions; or on one’s religious beliefs).  This course examines various approaches to the question of the meaning of life
bulletin.hofstra.edu,PHI,PHI110,The Meaning of the Meaning of Life,3,,PeriodicallyBefore we can answer a question philosophically; we must understand what the question asks. What is the meaning of life? – one of the most abiding philosophical questions – is problematic from this perspective. On one view; the question asks whether there is some ultimate purpose for the universe’s existence.  On another; it asks what makes for a satisfying life.  A third view holds that the very question is incoherent; while a fourth holds that the question really amounts to several different questions asking; for example; why anything at all exists; or if human life has value. This course will examine in detail these competing interpretations of the question; and the arguments for and against them.
